=================

This program, scrabblePwn, was written in part of a challenge against my mate Travis, https://github.com/ryuurei.
It's function is to autotype answers for the OMGPOP game, "Letterblox". It was written in 2011 and is totally open source, creative commons, all that fun stuff.
To execute, run as Main and provide the six letters the game provided you with to spell words as the first argument
Example: java scrabblePwn "ABCDEF"

You will have three seconds to redirect input to your browser, by clicking anywhere on the game itself. Wait patiently as the points roll in!
